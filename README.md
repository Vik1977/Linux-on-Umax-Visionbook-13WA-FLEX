# Linux-on-Umax-Visionbook-13WA-FLEX
Family member gave me this laptop, mine has a problematic keyboard, missing 3 keys, so it`s not much usable.

To this time i tried various distro and DE on it:
- Fedora whit [GNOME](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/), [KDE mobile](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/), [Phosh](https://puri.sm/posts/phosh-overview/)
- [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
- [Debian Trixie](https://www.debian.org/) whit [Phosh](https://puri.sm/posts/phosh-overview/), Lomiri


## During my testing i encountered various problems:

- [the trackpad isn`t recognized](trackpad-documentation.md)
- the fingerprint reader doesn`t work
- the automatic orientation of the screen orientates in the opposite way that you hold the device

## And wanted to apply some tweaks:

- make the device switch beetween laptop and tablet mode and disable automatically trackpad,keyboard and power button

## Usecases I came up with:

- use it to disply music notes
- to read books
- use it like tablet to menage my home and homelab trough web interface or app

## Progress:

- [ ] functioning trackpad
- [ ] functioni fingerprint reader
- [ ] fixed reversed rotation
- [ ] disable power button, keyboard and trackpad when in tablet mode
- [ ] find and install software to use it for my use cases
