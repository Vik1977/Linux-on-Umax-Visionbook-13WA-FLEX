# Linux-on-Umax-Visionbook-13WA-FLEX
Family member gave me this laptop, mine has a problematic keyboard, missing 3 keys, so it`s not much usable.

To this time i tried various distro and DE on it:
- Fedora whit Gnome, KDE mobile
- Linux Mint

## During my testing i encountered various problems:

- the trackpad isn`t recognized
- the fingerprint reader doesn`t work
- the automatic orientation of the screen orientates in the opposite way that you hold the device

## And due to the state of my machine i wanted to make some fixes to make it usable:

- disable the keyboard because its no longer of use
- make the device switch beetween laptop and tablet mode and disable automatically trackpad,keyboard and power button
- disable the power button when in tablet mode, so you dont suspend your machine by accident

## Progress:

- [ ] functioning trackpad
- [ ] functioni fingerprint reader
- [ ] fixed reversed rotation
- [ ] disable power button, keyboard and trackpad when in tablet mode


## Collaboration:
