# Linux-on-Umax-Visionbook-13WA-FLEX
__this project is not done, the little progress i has and the little support thet is given for this laptop (apparently the UMAX  publicly stated to not support linux) made me reconsider reinstalling windows on it.__

I installed windows 10 LTSC from the [MAS activation scripts](https://massgrave.dev/) website, using in tablet mode, the screen rotation works fine, touchpad works only the fingerprint reader dosent appear in device menager,  
its not my primary machine so im okay on having Windows on it, its useful for compatibility, if i find an NMVE for the expantion slot i could dual boot it.

Family member gave me this laptop, mine has a problematic keyboard, missing 3 keys, so it`s not much usable.

To this time i tried various distro and DE on it:
- Fedora whit [GNOME](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/), [KDE mobile](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/), [Phosh](https://puri.sm/posts/phosh-overview/)
- [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/)
- [Debian Trixie](https://www.debian.org/) with [Phosh](https://puri.sm/posts/phosh-overview/), Lomiri, GNOME onh xorg, KDE plasma, XFCE and Cinnamon


## During my testing i encountered various problems:

- [the trackpad isn`t recognized](trackpad-documentation.md)
- the fingerprint reader doesn`t work
- the automatic orientation of the screen orientates in the opposite way that you hold the device

## And wanted to apply some tweaks:

- make the device switch beetween laptop and tablet mode and disable automatically trackpad,keyboard and power button

## Usecases I came up with:

- use it to disply music notes
- to read books
- use it like tablet to menage my home and homelab trough web interface or app

## Progress:

- [ ] functioning trackpad
- [ ] functioni fingerprint reader
- [ ] fixed reversed rotation
- [ ] disable power button, keyboard and trackpad when in tablet mode
- [ ] find and install software to use it for my use cases
